## About the project 💻 
My project for the challenge was a game/interactive experience called “In a Sheet of Paper” (an adaptation of the popular Brazilian song [“Aquarela” by Toquinho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT8HIiFQ8Y0)). The name comes from the fact that the game is a guided drawing experience that encourages reflection and appreciation of the things you’ve built and your personal history.

## Development 👩🏻‍💻

When I first started working on the project, I quickly realized that I wasn’t as skilled in UI design as I thought. However, I didn’t let that stop me from pursuing my idea.

Instead of letting my weakness get the best of me, I decided to use it as the main value proposition of my project. I created an interface that was intentionally simple and minimalistic, and I let the users’ drawings be the main focus of the game. This not only allowed me to play to my strengths but also made the project unique and memorable.
